ShareLogic class for Universal Apps (C#)
=========================

This is a tutorial on how to use a class called ShareLogic which allows you to share information on your app, and more.

##Quick Code:
Today, this class is working the following way:

//invite your friends to use the app
- ShareLogic.InviteFriends();

//Send feedback back to the developer
- ShareLogic.SendFeedback();

//share app on twitter
- ShareLogic.ShareViaTwitter();

//show other apps developed by the developer 
- ShareLogic.ShowMoreApps();

//review the app
- ShareLogic.ShowReviewTask();
			

This code is to be used as is, i cannot garanty that this code will work everywhere, however this is the code that i use in my personal apps: http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Delaire%2BDamien

I will try to add more tutorial on how i use different components in Windows Phone, Windows Store and Universal Windows Apps
